Introduction 
---
This project is about implementing the construction of a parse tree for a propositional logic formula. Parse tree is the hierarchical representation of terminals or non-terminals. Input is in the form of propositional logic formula in infix notation. The project uses C++ as the base language for writing the code. The project has been really interesting and has helped us learn a lot of new things.

Thoughts behind selecting the Language
---
In this project we decided to use C++ due to the following reasons:
- Object Oriented language  
- Application of OOPS Course  
- Learning a new language in the process
