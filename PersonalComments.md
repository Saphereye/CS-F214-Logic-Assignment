## Adarsh Das

This project was fun...

### Thought behind selecting C++

- Object Oriented language
- Application of OOPS course
- New learning experience

### Adventures With Profiling

- `gprof` is only for runtime usage
- `-O0` had 23 lines, with the top most being precedence map being called 24 times
- `-O3` had 3 lines, with infixToPrefix being called 3 times 

### Thought behind Operator class
- `private` variables to stop malicious access
