This project was fun...

### Thought behind selecting C++

- Object Oriented language
- Application of OOPS course
- New learning experience

### Adventures With Profiling

- `gprof` is only for runtime usage
- `-O0` had 23 lines, with the top most being precedence map being called 24 times
- `-O3` had 3 lines, with infixToPrefix being called 3 times 

### Thought behind Operator class
- `private` variables to stop malicious access

### Thoughts behind TruthValStore class
- My initial thoughts were to use a map, sadly that's in stl library
- SO I made a new class with truth values stored in a binary number
- Example : `p`, `q`, `r` are `F`, `F`, and `T`. Then the binary number would be `0b100` where rightmost digit belongs to `p`
